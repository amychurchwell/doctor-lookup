## Assignment Requirements

_A reference for a forgetful student._

-- [x] Place your token in an .env file at the top level of your directory. (For grading purposes, name your API key variable exports.apiKey in .env. Keep spelling and capitalization identical, as it considerably speeds up the grading process.)

-- [x] Include .env in .gitignore.

-- [x] Use at least two JavaScript files: One to receive form input and another to make an API request and display results.

-- [x] This example assumes your API Key is stored in an apiKey variable, as described in this lesson. In order to make your applications quick to grade, please follow the example exactly and do not rename your apiKey variable to something different.
